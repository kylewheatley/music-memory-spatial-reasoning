						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>This study is an attempt to find the effect of spatial-temporal ability and repeated exposure to a simple melody on pitch memory as measured by the correctness of intervals and accuracy of starting and ending pitch. Participants were a volunteer population (N = 30) of music majors at the University of Alabama consisting of eight graduates and twenty-two undergraduates, sixteen vocalists and fourteen instrumentalists, and fourteen males and sixteen females.</p>

								<h3>Data Gathering Method</h3>
								<p>Participants first completed a spatial-temporal task on the Nintendo Wii<sup>TM</sup> game Big Brain Academy<sup>TM</sup> that has a section that requires the participant to complete ten
								exercises where a three-dimensional two-colored object that looks similar to a Rubik’s cube with a few pieces taken out is placed on the screen and rotated clockwise and the participant matched one of four possible figures to the initial object. After the exercises were finished, the game indicated how much time it took the participant to complete the exercises and the percent of the exercises that the participant got correct. For data analysis, the percent correct was inverted to show the percent incorrect and added to the amount of time it took to complete the exercises to create the Kyle Spatial Factor (KSF), which was the factor used to evaluate the spatial ability of participants.
								Participants were randomly placed into one of three groups using a set of numbers generated by the website randomizer.org to create the random placement list. After being placed in the groups the participant was told that they were going to listen short melody that was played once, 5, or 10 times (corresponding to their group placement), listen to 30 seconds of white noise, listen to a short narrative and then they will hum the melody back after the recording. All three items were on a continuous recording, and there was a two- second break between each section. Before the recording began, participants were asked to sit with their hands on their thighs and that singing, humming or using kinesthetic reinforcements like fingerings or hand-signs was not permissible. Upon being prompted from the study supervisor that they were close enough to the microphone, participants were then asked to hum the melody into the microphone and it was recorded. Participants were then thanked for their time and released. The recordings were listened to, analyzed using a strobe tuner to find the exact notes performed by the participant and then converted from cents +/- from the actual pitch to Hertz.</p>

								<h3>Results</h3>
								<p>After the collection of data it was put in an excel spreadsheet then organized by the researcher. The data was then imported into a data analysis program, SPSS. 
									Four statistical tests were conducted with the assistance of an experienced researcher in the field of music education at the University of Alabama.
									The first test was a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) arranged to evaluate the relationship between the number of repetitions of the melody heard by the participants (1, 5, or 10), participants’ primary instrument (voice vs. instrument), and the number of intervals participants performed correctly. Results yielded a statistically significant overall model, <i>F</i> (5, 24) = 6.26, <i>p</i> = .001, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .57. 
									The first main effect was the influence of repetitions on intervals performed correctly. Results were statistically significant, <i>F</i> (2, 24) = 3.64, <i>p</i> = .042, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .23 and a Tukey HSD post hoc test indicated statistically significant differences (<i>p</i> = .002) between the group of participants who heard the melody played once and 10 times. The group who had the melody played once performed fewer correct intervals (<i>M</i> = 1.17, <i>SE</i> = .24) when compared with the group who heard the melody played 10 times (<i>M</i> = 2.10, <i>SE</i> = .25). 
									Participants’ primary instrument, whether the subject was a vocalist or instrumentalist, was also statistically significant, <i>F</i> (1,24) = 14.58, <i>p</i> = .001, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .38. Examination of the mean correct intervals indicated that instrumentalists performed fewer correct intervals (<i>M</i> = 1.12, <i>SE</i> = .32) when compared to vocalists (<i>M</i> = 2.19, <i>SE</i> = .19). The interaction between the two factors (instrument and repetitions) was not statistically significant, <i>F</i> (2, 24) = 0.77, <i>p</i> > .05, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .06.
									The second test was a one-way ANOVA arranged to evaluate the relationship between the accuracy of the starting pitch performed by the participants (in Hz), the Kyle Spatial Factor (KSF), and the number of repetitions of the melody heard by the participants. Results yielded a statistically significant overall model, <i>F</i> (3, 26) = 3.69, <i>p</i> = .025, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .298. The first main effect was the influence of the KSF on the accuracy of the starting pitch performed by the participants. 
									Results were statistically significant, <i>F</i> (1, 26) = 9.02, <i>p</i> = .006, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .26. Also, while the overall model was significant the number of repetitions of the melody heard by the participants was not, however, there was a correlation between participants’ starting pitch and the KSF.
									The third test was a one-way ANOVA arranged to evaluate the relationship between the accuracy of the ending pitch performed by the participant (in Hz), the KSF and the number of repetitions of the melody heard by the participants. The results of this model were not significant, <i>F</i> (3, 26) = 2.668, <i>p</i> > .05, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .235, however, the KSF did yield a significant value that can show that it is a predictor of the ending pitch.
									The final analysis conducted is the same two-way ANOVA run in the first test but this time with the KSF as a covariant; results yielded a statistically significant overall model, <i>F</i> (6, 23) = 5.004, <i>p</i> = .002, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .566. The first main effect of this model was that the KSF was not statistically significant, <i>F</i> (1, 23) = .003, <i>p</i> > .05, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .000. The second main effect is similar to the second main effect from the first test on the analysis of whether the participant was a vocalist or instrumentalist and how many intervals they performed correctly, <i>F</i> (1, 23) = 13.659, <i>p</i> = .001, <i>n</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .373.</p>
								<h3>Discussion</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>There was major difference in the performance of the melody after it was heard 1 time versus 10 times. This says to us that as we are teaching that repetition is a major fact in correct performance, if the participant heard the melody 10 times there is a statistically significant probability that they will sing more correct intervals.</li>
									<li>Usual assumptions of instrumentalists and vocalists on pitch and melodic memory have been contradicted. It is a well-understood fact that because of the kinesthetic relationship to the instrument instrumentalists would better at reproducing pitches and melodies; however, it was found that vocalists actually sang more correct intervals on average. </li>
									<li>The KSF is a significant factor in predicting the ability to reproduce the starting pitch, a contributing factor in predicting the ability to reproduce the ending pitch, and has no relation to the ability to reproduce correct intervals.</li>
									<li>The test used to create the KSF is slightly negligible because it was adaptive and had no time constraints, which made it inconsistent in its evaluation process. Also, the use of white noise in the entirety or in small amounts could have actually been a major factor in the inability to remember pitch.</li>
									<li>The use of a different pre-test and further research into spatial-temporal ability will be of great use in further research in this virtually untouched field. </li>
